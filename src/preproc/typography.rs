//! Perform Wikidot's typographical modifications.
//! For full information, see the original source file:
//! <https://github.com/gabrys/wikidot/blob/master/lib/Text_Wiki/Text/Wiki/Parse/Default/Typography.php>
//!
//! The transformations performed here are listed:
//! * `` .. '' to fancy double quotes
//! * ` .. ' to fancy single quotes
//! * ,, .. '' to fancy lowered double quotes
//! * ... to an ellipsis
//!
//! Em dash conversion was originally implemented here, however
//! it was moved to the parser to prevent typography from converting
//! the `--` in `[!--` and `--]` into em dashes.
